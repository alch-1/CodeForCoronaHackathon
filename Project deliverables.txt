Telemedicine 
- Other apps out there, all we are doing is 
changing the service. How do we differenciate ourselves?
- Example - 7 cups, Hidoc, etc.

New focus
- mental health (both clinical and therapeutic) 
- a gap that we observe in Singapore
- many helplines and organisations but it is difficult 
to navigate (not sure who does what)
- ambiguity in defining an 'at risk' patient. Something that
is difficult to evaluate

Deliverables
- Questionaire to direct people to the right existing 
helpline/organisation
- Video/Voice call if possible to directly talk to counsellors

Agenda 8 May
- Figure out UI (both for user and psychiatrist) and 
get preliminary insights 
- Joven and Ryota to figure out how to code if possible
